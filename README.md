</p>

House Market Web is a React app mainly focused on Firebase functionality and design for mobile first. House Market consists in a simple context of a customer when logged in, can check out houses for sale and rent in the database, and it can also create a house for sale and rent.

This project was great for me to learn more about how to talk to an API, work with Firebase Storage and Authentication, Routers, and Maps.

## Roadmap

- Understand how a housing market works overall;
- Setup the data on firebase, authorization, and Firestore with users and house listings, and its logic;
- Put dummy data on firestore, and authorization for testing;
- Create register and login forms;
- Fetch the data from each user;
- Create a form for posting houses for sale or rent;
- Working around the Leaflet Map API to show the user the location of the house posted on for sale/rent;
- Finish styling the website using Toastify, and Swiper to make the overall functionality and presentation of the website better;
