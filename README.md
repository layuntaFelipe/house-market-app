</p>

House Market Web is a React app mainly focused on Firebase functionality and design for mobile first. House Market consists in a simple context of a customer when logged in, can check out houses for sale and rent in the database, and it can also create a house for sale and rent.

This project was great for me to learn more about how to talk to an API, work with Firebase Storage and Authentication, Routers, and Maps.

## About the API used

For this project I used the CoinGecko API, a very easy going no key API, with clean documentation and HTTPS. <br />
With the heelp of this API, you get all the market information about all the cryptos out there in the world. From the most known one like: Bitcoin, to Baby Doge Coin

## Roadmap

- Understand how the CoinGecko API works
- Layout the design for the page
- Use Axios to get the data from the API
- Use UseState and UseEffect to store and load the data from the API to their own components
- Use React-Router-Dom to link the home page to the specific coin page.
- Finish styling website to perfection


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Axios, React-Router-Dom
